#  Blockchain-based information modeling platform for industrial buildings

# I. Introduction

Blockchain-based industrial building information modeling system, as the name suggests, adopts China's domestic independent intellectual property rights of the "Chang'an Chain", and utilizes its technology to complete the credible storage of information. The front-end uses Threejs technology to complete its 3D visualization development and display. The back-end uses SpringBoot framework to complete the data business logic processing.

# II. Technology stack

Front-end Technology Stack：Vue、ElementUI、Echarts

Back-end Technology Stack：Springboot、MybatisPlus、MariaDB

# III. Start-up process

## 1. Front end：

1. Installing the Node.js environment (v16.17.0)
2. Run "npm install" (if you get an error, fix it yourself)
3. Run "npm run dev" to start the project.
4. Packing process by Google

## 2. Back-end：

1. Cloning a project from Github
2. Modify the application.yaml configuration file
3. Create the database (see "Data-Structure" folder for database data structure files) and start the database.
4. Updating Maven Dependencies
5. Start the server
6. Packing process by Google

## 3.Blockchain, Minio environment setup

For blockchain related, please refer to the Chang'an Chain official website (URL in reference VI) for building configuration and other operations.

Minio Distributed Storage, please refer to the Minio build tutorial to build it.

# V. Precautions

1. This project open source can be used at will, but it is prohibited **simple modification** after use as a graduation design, thesis and other ways.
2. This project is the author's graduation design If academic plagiarism, academic misconduct, etc. occurs at a later stage, the rights of the infringer will be defended according to their own losses.
3. This program does not place any restrictions on commercial use, but it is expected that relevant author information will be retained.
3. Due to the tight coding time of the project, there may be more bugs, you are welcome to submit code to merge.

# VI. Acknowledgements

Thanks to the Chang'an Chain platform engineers for their help with issues that arose when using Chang'an Chain in this project during the development process.
